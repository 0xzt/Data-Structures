    Search strings priorities were selected based on their probability of being searched upon. The four most common search item would be title, 
    author, ISBN and subject. First, the entire title or smaller portions of the title could be searched against while looking for a specific 
    book or one that includes the search contents within the title of the article.  Second most searched item could be the author or authors. 
    Again, entire author names or individual names, or portions of a name could be used to search for items written by a specific author or set 
    of authors. Third, ISBN number can be searched as just an array of numbers by omitting the hyphen from the search and database storage. 
    The last most commonly searched option could be subject. Typically, this is set of multiple subjects on which the book or item is written 
    about. Searches could be made by either a portion of the subject, or by selecting a pre-selected list of subjects. The less common search 
    options would include publisher, date of publication, location, and Dewey decimal code. The publisher could be searched in whole or by a 
    portion of the publisherâ€™s name. The date of publication can be stored as a date code, and as such, not require a string search. Location 
    would pertain to the physical location where the book or article is normally checked in. This could be searched by name, city, state or 
    country. Finally, the Dewey decimal code, a less common way to search when compared to ISBN. This would normally be location specific, however.
